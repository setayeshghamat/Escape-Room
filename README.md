# Cave Exploration, Escape Room

**Cave Exploration** is a Java-based adventure game developed as part of the *Object-Oriented Programming 2* course at the University of Strasbourg. The project focuses on applying object-oriented design principles through an interactive game in which players navigate a network of cave rooms, confront enemies, avoid hazardous traps, collect strategic items, and progress toward the exit of each level.

## 🎮 Game Features

* **Engaging Gameplay**
  Players control a character with configurable health and attack attributes while exploring interconnected cave environments populated with enemies and obstacles.

* **Collectible Items**

  * *Magic Potions*: Increase attack power
  * *Health Potions*: Restore player health
  * *Fireballs*: Offensive projectiles used against enemies

* **Enemy and Trap Systems**

  * Multiple enemy types with distinct behaviors, including enemies capable of passing through walls
  * Environmental hazards such as spike traps that cause instant death

* **Modular Code Architecture**

  * Codebase structured into clear packages separating game logic, game entities, and user interface components
  * Design adheres strictly to object-oriented programming best practices

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download the latest release: `Cave-Exploration.jar`
2. Run the application using:

   ```bash
   java -jar Cave-Exploration.jar
   ```
3. **Controls**

   * Movement: `Z`, `Q`, `S`, `D`
   * Mouse click: Launch fireballs

## 🛠 Development Highlights

* **Team-Based Development**
  Implemented collaboratively, emphasizing coordination and shared design decisions.

* **Robust Object-Oriented Design**

  * Abstract classes for generalized game entities
  * Enumerations for consistent identification of items and entities

* **Scalable and Maintainable Architecture**
  Modular, extensible structure with a clear separation of responsibilities.

* **UML-Driven Design Process**
  Class and sequence diagrams were used during the planning phase to guide implementation.

## 📌 Conclusion

**Cave Exploration** serves as both an interactive game and a technical demonstration of effective object-oriented programming, collaborative development, and structured software design. The project highlights clean architecture, thoughtful planning, and practical application of Java in an academic setting.
